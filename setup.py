from setuptools import setup

# The setup function is responsible for configuring the package and its dependencies.
# It is called with no arguments, which means it will use the configuration from the setup.cfg file.
# If you need to provide additional configuration, you can pass keyword arguments to the setup function.
# For example, you can specify the package name, version, author, etc. like this:
#
# setup(
#     name="my_package",
#     version="1.0.0",
#     author="Your Name",
#     author_email="your.email@example.com",
#     description="A short description of your package",
#     long_description="A longer description of your package",
#     url="https://github.com/yourusername/your-package",
#     packages=["my_package"],
#     classifiers=[
#         "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",
#         "Intended Audience :: Developers",
#         "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
#         "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
#         "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6",
#         "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7",
#         "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
#         "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
#     ],
#     install_requires=[
#         # List your package's dependencies here
#     ],
# )
#
# For more information on how to configure your package, refer to the setuptools documentation:
